# Stress resistance

## Definition

Stress resistance is the ability to cope with stress and pressure, whether it's related to work, relationships, or other aspects of life. It involves maintaining your mental and physical health in the face of adversity and being able to bounce back from difficult situations. Stress resistance is not the same as being stress-free, but rather, it's the ability to manage stress and not let it negatively impact your life.

People who are stress-resistant are able to maintain their emotional and physical wellbeing even in the face of challenging circumstances. They are able to stay calm, focused, and productive under pressure and are less likely to experience burnout or mental health problems.

Stress resistance is an important skill for anyone to develop, particularly for those in high-stress jobs, such as healthcare professionals, emergency responders, and business executives. By developing stress resistance, individuals can improve their ability to manage stress, reduce the negative impact of stress on their health and wellbeing, and achieve their goals more effectively.
