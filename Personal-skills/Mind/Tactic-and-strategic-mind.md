# Tactic and strategic mind

## Definition

A tactical mind is focused on the immediate and short-term actions required to achieve a specific goal or objective. It involves the ability to plan and execute actions quickly and effectively, often with limited information or resources.

On the other hand, a strategic mind is focused on the big picture and the long-term goals and objectives of an organization. It involves the ability to think ahead, anticipate potential challenges and opportunities, and develop plans and strategies to achieve success over the long term.

Both tactical and strategic thinking are important for success in many fields, including business, politics, and the military. The ability to balance short-term tactics with long-term strategy is often a key factor in achieving success.

## Why is it important

Tactical and strategic thinking are both important for solution architects in different ways. A solution architect needs to be able to think tactically to ensure that they can deliver practical solutions that meet the immediate needs of their organization. This involves being able to quickly and effectively analyze problems, identify potential solutions, and make informed decisions that address the issue at hand.

At the same time, a solution architect also needs to think strategically to ensure that they are developing solutions that align with the long-term goals and objectives of the organization. This involves understanding the broader business context and developing solutions that support the organization's overall strategy and vision.

By combining tactical and strategic thinking, a solution architect can develop solutions that are both practical and effective in the short term, while also supporting the long-term goals and objectives of the organization. This can help to ensure that the organization is able to achieve sustained success over the long term.

## How to improve

Improving tactical and strategic thinking skills requires practice and intentional effort. Here are some strategies to help improve these skills:

- **Read widely**: Reading a variety of materials, such as news articles, case studies, and academic research papers, can help broaden your perspective and improve your understanding of different situations and contexts.

- **Develop your analytical skills**: Analytical skills are essential for both tactical and strategic thinking. You can improve your analytical skills by practicing critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making exercises.

- **Build your knowledge base**: In order to be an effective solution architect, it's important to have a strong foundation of knowledge in relevant fields such as technology, business, and project management. Take courses, attend workshops and conferences, and seek out opportunities to learn from experts in these fields.

- **Practice active listening**: Effective communication is essential for both tactical and strategic thinking. Practice active listening by paying attention to what others are saying, asking clarifying questions, and summarizing key points.

- **Develop a long-term perspective**: To be an effective strategic thinker, it's important to develop a long-term perspective. This involves considering how decisions and actions today will impact the organization in the future.

- **Seek feedback**: Ask for feedback from colleagues, mentors, and other trusted individuals. This can help you identify areas for improvement and refine your tactical and strategic thinking skills.

By consistently practicing these strategies, you can improve your tactical and strategic thinking skills and become a more effective solution architect.
