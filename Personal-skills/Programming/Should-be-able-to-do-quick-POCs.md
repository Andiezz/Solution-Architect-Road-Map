# Should be able to do quick POCs

It is important for a solution architect to make quick proof of concepts for several reasons:

- **Validate ideas**: A proof of concept can help validate whether a particular approach or technology is feasible and can meet the requirements of the system. This can help avoid wasting time and resources on an approach that ultimately won't work.

- **Identify potential issues**: A proof of concept can help identify potential issues or challenges that may arise during implementation. This can help the architect anticipate and address these issues before committing to a design.

- **Communicate ideas**: A proof of concept can be a powerful tool for communicating design ideas to stakeholders, including developers, project managers, and business leaders. This can help build support for the proposed solution and ensure that everyone is on the same page.

- **Reduce risk**: By quickly prototyping and testing ideas, a solution architect can reduce the risk of delays, budget overruns, and other issues that may arise during implementation. This can help ensure that the project stays on track and delivers value to the business.

Overall, making quick proof of concepts is an important practice for solution architects because it can help validate ideas, identify potential issues, communicate ideas, and reduce risk. By quickly testing and iterating on ideas, architects can improve the overall quality of the system and ensure that it meets the needs of the business.
