# Should be very strong with coding in relevant technologies as per the technology stack of the organization

While it is not always necessary for a solution architect to be hands-on with programming, there are several benefits to having programming experience:

- **Better understanding of the system**: By having hands-on experience with programming, a solution architect can gain a deeper understanding of how the system works and how the different components interact with each other. This can help them make more informed design decisions and better communicate with developers.

- **More effective collaboration with development teams**: By having programming experience, a solution architect can communicate more effectively with developers and better understand their needs and concerns. This can help improve collaboration and reduce misunderstandings.

- **Improved problem-solving skills**: Programming requires strong problem-solving skills, and by having hands-on experience, a solution architect can develop these skills and apply them to other areas of their work.

- **Ability to prototype and experiment**: By having programming experience, a solution architect can prototype and experiment with different solutions more easily. This can help them quickly validate ideas and identify potential issues before committing to a design.

- **Better understanding of technology trends**: By staying up-to-date with programming trends and technologies, a solution architect can make more informed decisions about which technologies to use and how to integrate them into the system.

Overall, while programming experience is not always required for a solution architect, it can provide several benefits and help improve their effectiveness in the role.
