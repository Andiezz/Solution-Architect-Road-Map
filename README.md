This is a Skills map and roles&responsibilities of Solution Architects created by [Nikolai Ashanin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolay-ashanin-7bb3a57a/).

Solution Architect position becomes more and more popular nowadays. If 10 years ago, there were almost no such roles in IT companies then today those specialists can be seen in a lot of projects.

However, there are just a few sources and books which can help with Solution Architecture definition, Roles&Responsibilities and required skills.

The goal of this Road Map is to help in understanding what is Solution Architect role about and how to grow in that direction. To achieve this there is a plan to interview people who already plays Solution Architect role in different companies.
