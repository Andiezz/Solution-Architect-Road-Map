# Solution Architect Road Map

This is a Skills map and roles&responsibilities of Solution Architects created by [Nikolai Ashanin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolay-ashanin-7bb3a57a/).

Solution Architect position becomes more and more popular nowadays. If 10 years ago, there were almost no such roles in IT companies then today those specialists can be seen in a lot of projects.

However, there are just a few sources and books which can help with Solution Architecture definition, Roles&Responsibilities and required skills.
